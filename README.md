🚀 Excited to share my latest project: an ATM simulation program built with Python! 🏦💻

This program simulates a real-world ATM experience, featuring:

Card Insertion and PIN Verification: Ensures secure access with a delay for realism.
User-Friendly Menu: Options to check balance, withdraw funds, deposit funds, and exit.
Accurate Balance Management: Reflects real-time updates for withdrawals and deposits.
Error Handling: Manages invalid inputs gracefully for a seamless user experience.
This project has enhanced my understanding of Python programming, error handling, and user interaction design. Looking forward to tackling more complex projects and further honing my skills!
